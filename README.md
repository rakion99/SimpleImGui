# SimpleImGui

### Very simple imgui as example so you can start creating your own gui

## Compile, you will have a dll duh

## Inject dll to roblox

## After injecting press END and simpleImGui will appear

## Press END again to be able to go back to roblox again(or other window :P)

### This will not work for everyone duh

### This is like a overlay since its not using a dx11hook
